# Motivation

a collection of several operations on the database appear to be a single unit from the view of user

ex: a transfer of funding from a checking account to saving account

Database needs to ensure the proper execution of transactions and manage concurrent transactions



# ACID Properties

txn = begin txn + operations + end txn

|             | function                                                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| atomicity   | all-or-none                                                  |
| consistency | a txn starting from a consistent database will be consistent at the end of txn (start: A+B = 100, txn:  move 10 from A to Bend: A+B = 100) |
| isolation   | for every pair of txns Ti and Tj, it appears to Tj that either (Ti, Tj) or (Tj, Ti) |
| durability  | after a txn executes successfully, the change will persist despite of failure |



## Atomicity and Durability

### atomicity:

aborted: a txn does not complete its execution is termed aborted

rolled back: a txn has been rolled back if any changes made to database have been undone

committed: a txn that completes its execution successfully

compensating transaction: the only way to undo the effects of a committed txn



### durability

log: each database modification made by a txn is first recorded in the log



## Isolation

|                     | meaning                                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| serially            | at a time, each txn will start only after the previous txn has completed |
| schedules           | The execution sequences                                      |
| serial schedule     | instructions belonging to one single txn will appear together in that schedule |
| serializable        | the schedule is termed serializable if it is equivalent to a serial schedule |
| concurrency control | The part of database that ensures any schedule will leave the database in a  consistent state |

read: load value from database into a variable

write: store value of a variable in database

### Serializability

How to determine whether or not a schedule is serial?

| operations                        | swappable?                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| access different data items       | swappable                                                    |
| conflict (access same data items) | only in the case where both I and J are **read** instructions do I and J can swap |

### Isolation Levels

sometimes we can allow some inconsistency to speed up 

|                  | meaning                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| serializable     | ensures serializable execution                               |
| repeatable read  | (1) only committed data can be read (lock) (2) between 2 consecutive reads on 1 data item, there cannot be update |
| read committed   | (1) only committed data can be read(lock) (2) between 2 consecutive reads on 1 data item, there can be update |
| read uncommitted | allow uncommitted data to be read                            |

## Consistency

Concurrency Control

When serveral txns execute concurrently in the database, we need to use concurrency control to preserve isolation property



### Basic Concepts

#### lock

Difference between lock and latch

|               | lock                         | latch                    |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| where to lock | data item                    | index entry              |
| kinds         | shared lock + exclusive lock | read latch + write latch |

**Compatibility**

#### concurrency-control manager

#### deadlock

we need to use lock protocol to prevent deadlock



### two-phase locking protocol

|                 | operation                                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Growing phase   | a txn can obtain locks but cannot release any lock |
| Shrinking phase | a txn can release locks but cannot obtain any lock |

#### lock conversion

|           | operation                     |
| --------- | ----------------------------- |
| upgrade   | shared mode => exclusive mode |
| downgrade | exclusive mode => shared move |

#### lock table

data items: I7, I23, I912...

Txns: T23, T1, T8, T2...

<img src="C:\Users\jiaxi\Database\6Figures\lockTable.png" style="zoom:50%;" />



#### deadlock-prevention schemes

1. ordering requests for locks
2. using preemption and transaction rollbacks



**preemption**

When txn Ti requests a lock currently held by Tj, lock granted to Tj may be preempted by rolling back Ti and granting the lock to Tj



**preemption schemes**

| smallerTimeStamp-biggerTimeStamp / olderTxn-youngerTxn | Tj is older than Tj                      | Ti is younger than Tj   |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| wait-die                                               | wait -> Ti will wait for lock held by Tj | die -> Ti will rollback |
| wound-wait                                             | wound -> Tj will rollback                | wait -> Ti will wait    |
