# Motivation

a collection of several operations on the database appear to be a single unit from the view of user

ex: a transfer of funding from a checking account to saving account

Database needs to ensure the proper execution of transactions and manage concurrent transactions



# ACID Properties

txn = begin txn + operations + end txn

|             | function                                                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| atomicity   | all-or-none                                                  |
| consistency | a txn starting from a consistent database will be consistent at the end of txn (start: A+B = 100, txn:  move 10 from A to Bend: A+B = 100) |
| isolation   | for every pair of txns Ti and Tj, it appears to Tj that either (Ti, Tj) or (Tj, Ti) |
| durability  | after a txn executes successfully, the change will persist despite of failure |



## Atomicity and Durability

### atomicity:

aborted: a txn does not complete its execution is termed aborted

rolled back: a txn has been rolled back if any changes made to database have been undone

committed: a txn that completes its execution successfully

compensating transaction: the only way to undo the effects of a committed txn



### durability

log: each database modification made by a txn is first recorded in the log



## Isolation

|                     | meaning                                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| serially            | at a time, each txn will start only after the previous txn has completed |
| schedules           | The execution sequences                                      |
| serial schedule     | instructions belonging to one single txn will appear together in that schedule |
| serializable        | the schedule is termed serializable if it is equivalent to a serial schedule |
| concurrency control | The part of database that ensures any schedule will leave the database in a  consistent state |

read: load value from database into a variable

write: store value of a variable in database

### Serializability

How to determine whether or not a schedule is serial?

| operations                        | swappable?                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| access different data items       | swappable                                                    |
| conflict (access same data items) | only in the case where both I and J are **read** instructions do I and J can swap |

### Isolation Levels

sometimes we can allow some inconsistency to speed up 

|                  | meaning                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| serializable     | ensures serializable execution                               |
| repeatable read  | (1) only committed data can be read (lock) (2) between 2 consecutive reads on 1 data item, there cannot be update |
| read committed   | (1) only committed data can be read(lock) (2) between 2 consecutive reads on 1 data item, there can be update |
| read uncommitted | allow uncommitted data to be read                            |
