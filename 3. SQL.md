| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| char(n)                | a fixed-length character                                    |
| varchar(n)             | a variable-length character                                 |

| float(n)               | a floating-point number with precision of at least n digits |



General form of the **create table** command:

![](C:\Users\jiaxi\Database\3Figures\createTable.png)

**integrity constraints**: data stored in database must satisfy(primary key / foreign key)

|                                               | function                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| primary key (Aj1, Aj2, ..., Ajn)              | specify attributes that form the primary key                 |
| foreign key (Ai1, Ai2, ..., Ain) references s | specify attributes that form the primary key in another relation |
| not null                                      | the null value is not allowed for that attribute             |

## delete a table

**drop table** command: delete all information about the relation (delete tuples + relation)

ex: drop table r



## modify a table

### delete tuples

ex: delete from r; --> delete all tuples but relation r is retained 



### alter table by adding attributes

ex: alter table r add A, D; --> add attributes A, D to table r



### alter table by dropping attributes

ex: alter table r drop A; --> remove attribtue A from rable r



# SQL DML

## Query Operation

1. Generate a Cartesian product of relations listed in the **from** clause (relational algebra: Cartesian product)
2. Apply predicate(Cartesian product / select) in the **where** clause to filter out unqualified tuples (relational algebra:  join / select)
3. For each tuple left out in step2, output attributes specified in **select** clause (relational algebra: select + project)

ex:

<img src="C:\Users\jiaxi\Database\3Figures\ExQuery.png" style="zoom: 50%;" />

## Other Basic Operations

### de-duplicate operation

```sql
(2) select distinct dept_name
(1) from departmment
```



### rename operation

```sql
(3) select name as instructor_name, course_id
(1) from instructor, teaches
(2) where instructor.ID = teaches.ID

(3) select T.name, S.course_id
(1) from instructor as T, teaches as S
(2) where T.ID = S.ID
```



## Set Operations

### union

```sql
(select course_id
from sectoin
where semester = "Fall" and year = 2022;)
union
(select course_id
from sectoin
where semester = "Spring" and year = 2023;)
```



### intersect

```sql
(select course_id
from sectoin
where semester = "Fall" and year = 2022;)
intersect
(select course_id
from sectoin
where semester = "Spring" and year = 2023;)
```



### except

select all course ids in Fall 2022 but not in Spring 2023

```sql
(select course_id
from sectoin
where semester = "Fall" and year = 2022;)
except
(select course_id
from sectoin
where semester = "Spring" and year = 2023;)
```



## Aggregation Functions

### basic aggregations

take in a collection of values(of a whole column) and return a single value

```sql
Average: avg
Minimum: min
Maximum: max
Total: sum
Count: count

select avg(salary) as avg_salary
from instructor
where dept_name = 'CS'

select count(distinct ID) / count(*)
from course
```



### group by

form groups by given attributes

```sql
(4) select dept_name, avg(salary) as avg_salary
(1) from instructor
(3) group by dept_name
```

(2) group by

<img src="C:\Users\jiaxi\Database\3Figures\ExGroupBy1.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

(1) result 

<img src="C:\Users\jiaxi\Database\3Figures\ExGroupBy2.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

### having

predicate in having clause will be applied to each group after groups have been formed

1. from: Cartesian product of relations
2. where: filter out tuples
3. group by: form groups
4. having: filter out groups
5. select: choose attributes

```sql
select course_id, semester, year, sec_id avg(tot_cred)
from student, takes
where student.ID = takes.ID
group by course_id, semester, year, sec_id 
having count(ID) >= 2;
```

Notice that all attributes used to form groups must exist in new attributes



### Set Comparison

|       |                                                              |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| some  | select the tuple whose specific value is greater than at least one values in a column |
| all   | select the tuple whose specific value is greater than all values in a column |
| exist | return true if relation is not empty                         |

```sql
#some
select name
from instructor
where salary > some (select salary
                    from instructor
                    where dept_name = 'Biology')

#all
select dept_name
from instructor
group by dept_name
where salary > all (select salary
                    from instructor
                    where dept_name = 'Biology')
                    
#exist
select S.ID, S.name
from student as S
where not exists (select ... )
```



### with 

create temporary table with new attributes

template:

```sql
with new_relation_name (new_attribute_name) as 
	(select old_attribute_name ... )
```

ex:

```sql
with max_budge (value) as
	(select max(budge)
    from department)
    
# use temporary relation
select budget
from department, max_budge
where department.budget = max_budget.value
```



## Modification of Database

### Deletion

delete all tuples satisfying predicate from a relation. Each deletion can only operate on one relation.

```sql
delete from instructor
where dept_name = 'Finance'
```



### Insertion

insert tuples into a relation

(1) specify attributes

```sql
insert into course(course_id, title, dept_name, credits)
	values('CS-115', 'DB','CS','4' );
```

(2) insert results of subquery

```sql
insert into student
	select *
	from student;
```



### Update

```sql
(1) update instructor
(2) set salary = salary * 1.5
(3) where salary < 7000
```
