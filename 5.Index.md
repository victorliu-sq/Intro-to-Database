# Motivation

To facilitate query of a specific tuple in a relation. W/O Indices, we have to look up all tuples in a relation



# Ordered Indices

values of search keys are in sorted order

records themselves are store in some sorted order



Dense Indices: one index entry to one record

Spare Indices: one index entry to multiple records

# Hash Indices

bucket: a unit of storage in relation that can store one or more records

hash function: a function mapping from search-key values to bucket addresses
