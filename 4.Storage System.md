## File Organization

### fixed-length records

Problem:

(1) blocks can hard be multiples of a specific size(53 bytes) so some records may cross block boundary

(2) difficult to delete a record from this structure.



How to delete (silly):

(1) move record move after it to the empty space until every record following the deleted record moves forward

(2) move the final record of the file into the space of the deleted record

Generally insertion is more frequent than deletion, so we can mark the space as deleted smartly by **file header**. Deleted space is stored in file header.

On insertion of a new record, we use record pointed by file header. If no space is available, we add the new record to the end of file

1.  if file header is not empty, insert the record to first available space
2.  if file header is empty, insert record to end of file

### variable-length records

Representation of a variable-length record

| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| attributes of variable-length   | In initial part, a pair of offset and length. after Initial part, values of these attributes |
| attributes of fixed-size length | In initial part, information                                 |
| null bitmap                     | null value is set to 1                                       |

initial part(pair of variable + values of fixed-size) + null bitmap + values of variable

### Slotted-page structure

Store variable-length records in a block.

## Data-Dictionary Storage

|                                  | function                                              |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| metadata                         | data about data                                       |
| data dictionary / system catalog | relational schemas and other metadata about relations |



## Database Buffer

### buffer

Motivation:  data access from disk is much slower than in-memory data access.



### buffer manager

Motivation: buffer manager is to minimize # of blocks transferred between disk and memory



### pinned blocks

When a block is being read or written, we cannot evict the page

| Operation | Motivation                                                   |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| pin       | 1 process is going to operate on 1 block                     |
| unpin     | read/written on 1 block has finished                         |
| pin_count | block cannot be evicted until all processes that pin it execute unpin op |



### buffer replacement strategy
